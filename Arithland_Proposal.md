# **Arithland Online Competition Platform**

## **Project Definition**
Many students become discouraged from learning mathematics due to a lack of access to proper resources and ineffective teaching methods. The *Arithland* competition has been held in Iran for 26 years as an in-person event to gamify this process. However, in-person competitions have limitations for the judging and execution teams. This project aims to create an online platform for hosting these competitions.

### **Core Features**
- User registration and authentication
- Standard and real-time judging
- Banking system
- Competition analysis

### **Optional Features**
- Smart cheating detection system
- Web-based chatroom
- Black market (semi-legal question trading store)

## **Project Phases**

### **Phase 0: Business Analysis and Prerequisite Learning**
In this phase, the product owner and business analyst conduct an in-depth study of the project’s requirements and design the initial schema. The design and development team also focuses on learning the necessary technologies, including Django, JavaScript, UX Design, etc. Additionally, the product analyst completes the proposal and initial documentation.

### **Phase 1: Design**
Based on the documents from the previous phase, the back-end team designs the database and backend schema, while the UI/UX designer focuses on designing the website’s interface and visual identity according to the business analysis. The front-end developer continues skill development, and the product analyst monitors the team’s activities and compiles reports using the *Mizito* platform. The product owner, in addition to managing the team, prepares the necessary Git Flow infrastructure and trains the development team on its usage.

### **Phase 2: Development**
The front-end developer collaborates with the UI/UX designer to implement the pages using the infrastructure built by the product owner. Meanwhile, the back-end team engineers the data flows. The QA tester evaluates the front-end designs for content accuracy and responsiveness.

### **Phase 3: Debugging, Deployment, and Performance Testing**
The front-end and back-end components are integrated, and the final debugging process takes place. The QA tester plays a crucial role in this phase. Once debugging is complete, the project is deployed on a test server, and load testing is conducted by the development team. Performance tuning is performed if necessary before delivering the product to the client.

### **Phase 4: Delivery and Support**
At this stage, the project is tested in real competition environments and monitored for improvements.
